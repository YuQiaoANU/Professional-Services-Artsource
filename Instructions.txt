To modify the db, you need change code in model files, then use below command lines:
python manage.py makemigrations 
python manage.py migrate 

make sure you are on the same dir that contains manage.py
create requirements.txt, put it in the same dir of manage.py
pip3 maybe changed to pip
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

if you just need the modules for this project rather than the virtual environment:
pip3 install pipreqs
pipreqs ./  #if show errors, use the bottom command
pipreqs ./ --encoding=utf-8

Install the required modules, if network is too slow, try to use other source:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

you can run server by:
python manage.py runserver
if you need ssl to ensure the https features (so you can use thrid party authentication)
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file cert.crt
When you have your own certificate:
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file /tmp/cert.crt

create super user by:
python manage.py createsuperuser

check the backend by:
the ip+/admin
Notice: only the databse table recorded by admin.site can show in admin backend
Which generally added in admin.py file:
like the code: admin.site.register(models.User)

For the email configuration, you need set the mail server 
1. cd into the asg_web_app
2. open the setting.py
3. scroll down to the bottom then you can find the info you need
